Call
- has a question ID
- Can target either:
	- known cap (import)
	- promised answer
		- includes question ID
		- + path to cap

Return
- refers to a question ID

Finish
indicates we've received the return so that the caps can be optionally
auto-released



From a user perspective:

root := get_root()

// want only a single value returned so things can be chained
promise := root.callFunc(...)

promise hasn't been resolved at this point

// foo is still a promise
foo := promise.FooStruct()

// cap is still a promise
cap := foo.BarCap()

// this can proceed immediately
cap.callOtherFunc()
