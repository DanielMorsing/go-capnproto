# This file defines the "network-specific parameters" in rpc.proto to support a network consisting
# of two vats:  a container, and the vat it contains.  The container may actually be a full sandbox
# that confines the inner app.  The contained app can only speak to the outside world through the
# container.  Therefore, from the point of view of the containee, the container represents the
# whole world and all capabilities in the rest of the world appear "hosted" by the container.
# Meanwhile, the container proxies any capabilities exported by the containee, and thus the rest of
# the world only sees the container, and treats it as if it were itself the host of all of the
# containee's objects.
#
# Since there are only two vats in this network, there is never a need for three-way introductions,
# so level 3 is free.  Joins _could_ be needed in cases where the container itself participates in
# a network that uses joins, as the container may export two objects to the containee which,
# unbeknownst to it, are actually proxies of the same remote object.  However, from the containee's
# point of view, such a join is trivial to request, and the containee never needs to receive join
# requests.
#
# Therefore, a level 4 implementation of the confined network is barely more complicated than a
# level 1 implementation.  However, such an implementation is able to make use of the container's
# implementation of whatever network it lives in.  Thus, if you have an application that implements
# the confined network at level 4, your application can participate in _any_ network at level 4 so
# long as you pair it with the appropriate container.
#
# The "confined" network protocol may also be a reasonable basis for simple two-party client-server
# interactions, where the server plays the part of the container.
